description: >
  You awake with a start, it is still very dark, you glance at your Phone, it shows 01:03am, you can hear rain pattering on the roof,
  and the air feels unusually cold for a spring evening.

  It is still the middle of the night, you think to yourself as you close your eyes again. "I hope I can fall back to sleep".

  You roll to the other side of the bed to hug your boyfriend, however as yours arms only touch cold empty space, a growing anxiety begins to take hold.
  Your boyfriend is not here.

  Calm down, you think to yourself, surely he has only gone to the bathroom, you decide to get out of bed to go and check. You take your Phone with you to illuminate the way, however the battery has run out.

      You glance briefly around the room, it is very dark, but you can make out the shapes of all sorts of things. The bookshelf is overflowing
      with thick old books, arts and crafts supplies and strange bits and pieces collected over many years.
      To the north is the Upstairs Bathroom, the Heavy Door is shut tight. Further along the hallway to the east is your brother Martin's Bedroom.
      His door is also shut, not surprising given the time of night. At the far end of the hallway, sits a giant wardrobe and your old lounge, 
      it is not used much anymore. Above the lounge hangs a bath Towel. The stairs leading down are very dark, you cannot see the bottom at all.
