description: >
  You awake with a start, it is still very dark, you glance at your Phone, it shows 01:03am, you can hear rain pattering on the roof,
  and the air feels unusually cold for a spring evening.

  It is still the middle of the night, you think to yourself as you close your eyes again. "I hope I can fall back to sleep".

  You roll to the other side of the bed to hug your boyfriend, however as yours arms only touch cold empty space, a growing anxiety begins to take hold.
  Your boyfriend is not here.

  Calm down, you think to yourself, surely he has only gone to the bathroom, you decide to get out of bed to go and check. You take your Phone with you to illuminate the way, however the battery has run out.

      You glance briefly around the room, it is very dark, but you can make out the shapes of all sorts of things. The bookshelf is overflowing
      with thick old books, arts and crafts supplies and strange bits and pieces collected over many years.
      To the north is the Upstairs Bathroom, the Heavy Door is shut tight. Further along the hallway to the east is your brother Martin's Bedroom.
      His door is also shut, not surprising given the time of night. At the far end of the hallway, sits a giant wardrobe and your old lounge, 
      it is not used much anymore. Above the lounge hangs a bath Towel. The stairs leading down are very dark, you cannot see the bottom at all.

      You flip on the lightswitch and enter your sister Cassandra's Bedroom. Your eyes dart quickly around the room, but with less surprise this time,
      you discover Cassandra is not in her room. Your mind is racing full of confusion and anxiety as you take a seat on the end of her bed and try to think the situation though.


      It is the middle of the night, nobody is in bed, there are lots of unexpected items in the house and the bathroom door is locked. What does it all mean?


      After a few minutes, doing the best you can to stay calm, you decide that there is only two things to be done. One, you should check on your Brother Martin, and two, you have to find a way into that bathroom, it can only be locked from the inside, so someone HAS to be in there!

      As you get up to leave the bedroom, you pause for a moment as your eyes focus on a Box of Cigarettes your sister has on the window sill.
