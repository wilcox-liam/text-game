      This is your bedroom, you glance around in the dark and you are able
      to recgonise the outlines of the familar objects in your room.
      Your desk is next to you, your laptop sits closed on top of it.
      You can see the wardrobe in front of you, it is ajar...
      Liam always forgets to shut it. Everything appears to be normal
      except for one thing... Your boyfriend is not here.
