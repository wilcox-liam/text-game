description: >
  You awake with a start, it is the middle of the night, you can hear rain pattering on the roof,
  and the air feels unusually cold. 

  Suddenly you realise that you have an urgent need to use the bathroom, so you grab your phone,
  but before you get out of bed you pause for a moment... something feels ... wrong.

      Your desk is in the corner, your laptop sits closed on top of it.
      You can see the wardrobe in front of you, it is ajar...
      Liam always forgets to shut it. Everything appears to be normal
      except for one thing... Your boyfriend is not here!
       
      He must be in the bathroom, you decide to get out of bed to go and check.
