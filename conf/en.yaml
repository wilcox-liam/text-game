name: Haunted's House
description: >
  You awake with a start, it is the middle of the night, you can hear rain pattering on the roof,
  and the air feels unusually cold. 

  Suddenly you realise that you have an urgent need to use the bathroom, so you grab your phone,
  but before you getting out of bed you reach for your boyfriend next to you, gently at first tapping around
  the far side of the bed with your hand. As each tap of the hand touches cold empty bed, a growing anxiety takes hold.
  Your boyfriend is not here.

  Calm down, you think to yourself, surely he is only in the bathroom, you decide to get out of bed to go and check.
