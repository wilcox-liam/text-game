description: "You awake with a start, it is still very dark, you glance at your phone,
  it shows 12:11am, you can hear rain pattering on the roof, and the air feels unusually
  cold for a summer evening.\nSuddenly you realise that you have an urgent need to
  use the bathroom, so you swing your legs out of bed and grab your Phone to light
  the way, but before standing up you reach for your boyfriend next to you, gently
  tapping around the far side of the bed with your hand.  As each tap of the hand
  touches cold empty bed, a growing anxiety takes hold.Your boyfriend is not here.\nCalm
  down, you think to yourself, surely has only gone to the bathroom, you decide to
  get out of bed to go and check.  \n"

    There is a small alcove to the south leading to an esuite.

    to touch and shake awake.\nBut as you slap your hand around on top of the bed,
