description: "You awake with a start, it is the middle of the night, you can hear
  rain pattering on the roof, and the air feels unusually cold. \nSuddenly you realise
  that you have an urgent need to use the bathroom, so you grab your phone,  but before
  you get out of bed you pause for a moment... something feels ... wrong.\n"

    You glance around in the dark and you are able to recgonise the outlines of the familar objects in your room. Your desk is in the corner, your laptop sits closed on top of it. You can see the wardrobe in front of you, it is ajar... Liam always forgets to shut it. Everything appears to be normal except for one thing... Your boyfriend is not here.
